        <p style="color:red;"> Ever wonder what it's like to be a fish in a bowl? <br>They are orange, hungry and responsive.<br>  They spend all day in a tank, sometimes with no interaction except with their reflecitions and shadows. 
        <p>Ever wonder if they wonder.  What is it like to be a fish?</p>
